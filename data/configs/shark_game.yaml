        like crabs and shrimp along with mollusks and small fishes.
      sharkFactRevealDepends:
      - bonnethead_diet_0
    - sharkFactTitle: Unique Diet
      sharkFactInfo: One of a few shark species found to be an omnivore, with seagrass
        making up a significant portion of their diet. Using carbon isotope labelled
        seagrass it was proven that they actually absorb nutrients from the seagrass.
        They have also been found to have enzymes that can break down cellulose.

      sharkFactInfo: Yolk-sac placental viviparous with the shortest gestation period
        of any shark at just 4-5 months.

      - white_diet
    - sharkFactTitle: Behavior
      sharkFactInfo: In some parts of the world have been observed to breach completely
        out of the water when hunting seals. They will hunt seals in deep water and
        explode towards the surface, launching themselves and likely their prey into
        the air.
      sharkFactRevealDepends:
      - white_behavior

      - white_migration
    - sharkFactTitle: Biology
      sharkFactInfo: Have a unique physiology that allows them to maintain a body
        temperature higher than the surrounding water allowing them to go into colder
        water than most species of sharks.
      sharkFactRevealDepends:
      - white_biology

      sharkFactInfo: Reach sexual maturity around 30 years of age and can live up

      sharkFactRevealDepends:
      - white_age
    - sharkFactTitle: Reproduction
      sharkFactInfo: Aplacental viviparous with unborn embryos not just gaining nutrition
        from a yolk sac but also from unfertilized eggs but no placental connection
        is formed. They have litter sizes on average of 2-10 pups but have been seen
        to have as many as 17 pups.

      sharkFactRevealDepends:
      - bull_age
    - sharkFactTitle: Reproduction
      sharkFactInfo: Placental viviparous with a gestation period of about 10-11 months.
        They give birth to 1-15 pups at a time in sheltered inland areas.
      sharkFactRevealDepends:
      - bull_reproduction
    - sharkFactTitle: Unique Habitat
      sharkFactInfo: Can adjust to a large range of salinities, allowing them to swim
        into freshwater like rivers and lakes accessible from the ocean. Young bull
        sharks spend a significant amount of their early life in freshwater, away
        from the many predators found in the ocean (including adult bull sharks).
      sharkFactRevealDepends:
      - bull_habitat_1
    - sharkFactTitle: Behavior
      sharkFactInfo: Known to hunt in murky waters with low visibility. Instead of
        eye sight, they use their sense of smell, electroreception, and their lateral
        line. The lateral line is a touch sense that can feel water movement from
        other animals.
