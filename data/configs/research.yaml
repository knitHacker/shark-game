    feed on fish and small sharks while adults mainly prey on marine mammals such
    as seals, dolphins, and whales.

  researchPaperName: White Shark Behavior
  researchDescription: In some parts of the world white sharks have been observed
    to breach completely out of the water when hunting seals. They will hunt seals
    in deep water and explode towards the surface, launching themselves and likely
    their prey into the air.

  researchDescription: White sharks have a unique physiology that allows them to
    maintain a body temperature higher than the surrounding water allowing them
    to go into colder water than most species of sharks.

  researchPaperName: White Shark Reproduction
  researchDescription: White sharks are aplacental viviparous with unborn embryos
    not just gaining nutrition from an yolk sac but also from unfertilized eggs
    but no placental connection is formed. They have litter sizes on average of
    2-10 pups but have been seen to have as many as 17 pups.

  researchPaperName: Bull Shark Unique Habitat
  researchDescription: Bull sharks can adjust to a large range of salinities, allowing
    them to swim into freshwater like rivers and lakes accessiable from the ocean.
    Young bull sharks spend a significant amount of their early life in freshwater,
    away from the many predators found in the ocean (including adult bull sharks).

bull_behavior:
  researchPaperName: Bull Shark Behavior
  researchDescription: Bull sharks are known to hunt in murky waters with low visibility.
    Instead of eye sight, they use their sense of smell, electroreception, and their
    lateral line. The lateral line is a touch sense that can feel water movement
    from other animals.
